      <description>Who Is Joey Hops? Hi there! I&amp;rsquo;m Joe Hopkins, or Joey Hops if you prefer. I&amp;rsquo;m a software engineer here in beautiful Calgary, Alberta. Currently I&amp;rsquo;m working for a company called Wiles Jackson Inc. as a Full Stack Software Engineer. Recently we&amp;rsquo;ve been tapped by Trans Mountain (the pipeline guys) to manage and develop custom Sharepoint solutions for them, our biggest project being the PALMS Permit and Compliance Management system, a Modern Sharepoint Webpart developed using ReactJS and Typescript.</description>
